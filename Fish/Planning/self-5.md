- the data definition, including interpretation, of penguin movements for turns
https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/cox/blob/752949ee4b44226a454b64eda928127ed760d15c/Fish/Player/Other/main/java/Strategy.java#L39-L50

For a Move Action, please see https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/cox/blob/752949ee4b44226a454b64eda928127ed760d15c/Fish/Common/FishCode/src/main/java/Move.java#L3-L21

- the unit tests for the penguin placement strategy
https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/cox/blob/752949ee4b44226a454b64eda928127ed760d15c/Fish/Player/Other/test/java/StrategyTest.java#L166-L195

- the unit tests for the penguin movement strategy; 
  given that the exploration depth is a parameter `N`, there should be at least two unit tests for different depths 
  https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/cox/blob/752949ee4b44226a454b64eda928127ed760d15c/Fish/Player/Other/test/java/StrategyTest.java#L197-L218
  
- any game-tree functionality you had to add to create the `xtest` test harness:
  - where the functionality is defined in `game-tree.PP`
  - where the functionality is used in `xtree`
  - you may wish to submit a `git-diff` for `game-tree` and any auxiliary modules
